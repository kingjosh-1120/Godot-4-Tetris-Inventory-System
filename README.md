# Tetris_Inventory
 Tetris-based Inventory System in GODOT 4. My attempt at recreating inventory systems found in games such as Resident Evil 4 using the Godot 4 engine.

 NOTE: The way that this system works is that the pixel size of the objects MUST match the grid size of the sprite you are using to represent the inventory system. For example, this means that if your grid width and height are done in multiples of
32 pixels (eg. one cell is 32 by 32 pixels), your objects should all also have width and heights that are multiples of 32. This project is a WORK IN PROGRESS. There are some issues right now with aligning objects exactly with the grid, which will 
be worked on and fixed eventually.

Feel free to use these files / ideas from this implementation in your own projects should you want to do so.
